# Test Plan
**Author**: Team 48
## 1. Testing Strategy
### 1.1 Overall strategy
The android application ‘SDPCryptogram’, will heavily abstract away the logic into database calls to android’s SQLite provider. We can think of the application consisting mostly of database utility functions, and activity files that are responsible for the user interface and interacting with these database functions.
The database functions present in DB.java will be the inspiration for the unit tests that are currently present in DatabaseTest.java. These unit tests will make sure to test each function in the file and each possible return value for these functions. Likewise, we aim to cover the branches in these methods so that we have the highest statement and branch coverage as possible.
The activity files will test the user interactions as well as the application logic outside of the database. This is where we can test system and integration tests, via Espresso. We can test the interactions with the database as part of interacting with the UI, test error messages, test transitions to activities, and all other application logic outside of the database. Likewise, we can easily run our regression tests when we change something in the Database or other activity files by running the full activity suite. The nice thing about this strategy is that it involves the easy use of a full end-to-end test script that creates multiple users, multiple cryptograms, tests all the displays, etc.
Rob will be responsible for the activity tests and the basic skeleton of the database tests, while Chris, Rushabh and Jason will finish the many, many unit tests present in the DatabaseTest file.




We can think of the basic tests as falling into seven categories:
1. Creating a player
2. Logging in as a player
3. Creating a cryptogram
4. Solving a cryptogram
5. Viewing lists of completed cryptograms
6. Viewing lists of unsolved cryptograms
7. Viewing the statistics of cryptograms


Each of these seven categories contains its own unique activity file, and several database calls, all of which will need to be tested. The unit tests break down the individual functions in the database.


Development of the application will be performed on computer systems using IDE “Android Studio”. But, to ensure reliable performance of the App on the mobile device the App will be installed on an actual android device and tested for unusual behaviour on the device. Some of these behaviour criteria to be tested includes unusual battery drain because of the App, unnecessary permission request for the app, the abrupt crash of the app, smooth transition of the app between different device orientation etc. It should be specified that the application is targeted at a Android SDK 26, with a minimum of 23. 


During regression testing, the features of the of the app that are vital for the user experience and performance will be tested. Also, during the future releases of the App, the complete set of database and activity tests will be performed to prevent the new bugs from creeping up in the code. During regression testing, special emphasis will be given to the testing of old bugs to make sure old, previously fixed issues do not reappear.


Finally, Unit tests will be prepared and executed during implementation by the developer of the specific code. To ensure thorough testing of the app on different devices, all the team members will be downloading the app on their devices and perform the function and system tests.


### 1.2 Test Selection


Testing the database with unit tests consists of both black-box and white-box testing techniques. We will rely on the strategy of identifying boundary values with respect to category partitions so that we can know which are the proper types of inputs to test for our unit tests. By using the table creation statements for cryptograms, puzzles and players, we have a very food idea of what category partition values need to be tested. For example, since players need to have unique usernames, and these usernames need to be of >= 1 character, we will need unit tests for repetitive usernames, usernames of 0 characters, usernames of 1 characters, and usernames of 2+ characters. Similar strategies can be implored for other fields in the database tables, and the logic of DB.java that interacts with table creation, updates, and select statements as per the requirements outlined in Assignment 5.


White-box testing will be a smaller, but useful component to the unit tests as well. The DB plans to be written with as little coupling as possible, so branch and statement coverage techniques should be easy to verify. We will also verify in our unit tests each of the possible return values, primarily for success and failure, for the database calls. Similar strategies are used in the activity files.


Functional tests, system tests, and integration tests will be done by users across various Android devices, and these primarily rely on black-box testing techniques. Espresso makes it easy for us to utilize the model-based testing that was outlined in the black-box testing lecture. Specifically, we plan to follow the pipeline from functional requirements -> independently testable features -> relevant inputs -> test case specifications -> test cases. This will be greatly useful for the activity tests because this means we will be able outline the use cases and tests in parallel. 


Any end-to-end tests will follow a pipeline that integrates much of the activity testing in a logical order so that we can test a full use case in Espresso. This will be a great possibility for a full system test and regression test to run on multiple Android systems. 


### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion
The unit tests will ensure the accuracy of individual methods and classes of the code, but primarily the database. However, the overall quality of the App will be ensured by implementing multiple test cases during the functional, integration and system testing. The test cases will test for both functions of the app activities, the error messages, the . This will minimize the possibility of bugs in the system. The following criteria will be considered for maximum code coverage during various stages of testing.


#### 1.3.1 Statement coverage and Input Partitioning:
Because the program logic is essentially split because database functionality and activity files, we can test these with statement coverage metrics quite easily. For each database table schema, we can generate and test the boundary inputs for each of the table creation statements. We will need select statements for all three tables, and insert statements as well. One benefit of this is that we can test the inserts and select statements together.


Input partitioning is key here. This follows the constraints of the tables to know that we are covering the boundaries properly. Likewise, this strategy can be used to test, for instance, the number of attempts remaining on a given cryptogram for a user.


#### 1.3.1 Branch coverage: 
The test suite should cover all the branches or condition statements of the program in both the activity files as well as the database calls. Jacoco Framework is used to generate automatic coverage report with statistics about branch coverage and statement coverage. 


### 1.4 Bug Tracking
Our team plans to use the “Issues” functionality supplied in GitHub for bug and issue tracking. We found however, after a few days of development, that a separate google docs file ended up being a better way to coordinate together.


### 1.5 Technology
We will need a number of Android technologies for testing:
JUnit for Unit Testing of DB and some activity methods.
Hamcrest for some core library string operations.
Android Espresso for Functional Testing and much of the UI testing, and end-to-end tests.
Android Rule for Activity testing help.
Android Instrumentation Registry for default Context support
Android Runner for Activity testing help.
Jococp Framework for Test Coverage Reports.


## 2. Test Cases


#### Automated Functional Tests:
The functional tests in this program, as well as the end to end tests, are written in Espresso. When running these tests, you should keep in mind that the database **does not** delete everything before running them. They expect a clean DB. This is because Espresso is literally interacting with the app, and if testing something like a repetitive user name failing, we need a clean database with which to properly test this functionality. The following table outlines each of these activity files, and the tests that are included in their espresso runs. You can verify these yourself by running them from Android studio from the androidtest folder, but make sure your emulator is **turned on**. 


The tests are ordered by activity, with the first for each activity listed in bold. Some method names are split into several lines for more readable table formatting.

|27. | StatActivityTest | endToEndTopThree VerificationFor CreatedCryptogram | This serves as an end-to-end test that creates a cryptogram, then goes through a loop of four users that create user accounts, log in, solve the cryptogram, and log out. Then, one of the users logs in an finds the cryptogram in the completed table and verifies the solver list statistics for the cryptogram are correct. While the test checks the list of usernames, this should be manually verified as well | All users created, cryptogram solved, and statistics are correct after all four have solved  | All users created, cryptogram solved, and statistics are correct after all four have solved | Pass | Manually verify some stats


It should be noted that not all UI components have a specific test for Espresso, but only the ones that provide adequate coverage for testing the client-side interaction with the database, as well as the important components following the requirements. Manual verification is still a very big part of this process and needs to be done thoroughly with many devices even when all of the functionality tests pass. 


For testing the server-side of the application, so to speak, we turn to the tests in DatabaseTest that will test all the rest of the functionality of the application.


#### End-To-End Giant Unit Test For Regression, Learning, Sanity.
There is also a file called EndToEndMonsterTest that is a 350-line sequence of actions run on Espresso that tests the vast majority of the functionality of the app, including most error messages, database interactions for all puzzles, and all activities. This is a very useful test to see both how the app works, but also how it runs on various devices without having to manually go through all the different test cases on every single device. After running through ~350 instructions of sequences of actions, creating multiples users and cryptograms, solving some cryptograms, failing some for various reasons, the test passes a final stat assertion. While this is not formally part of the requirements of the assignment, this is good practice for *regression testing** and for verify


#### Unit Tests:


There are 60 individual unit tests for the database that test the various function calls. Between the client and the server (database), we have statement coverage in our application, but not quite full branch coverage (but very close). The following are the results of our unit tests:

## 3. Test Coverage and Test Result Reports

Jacoco framework was used to generate test coverage reports. The Detailed Test coverage Reports as well Detailed Test Results are available in the Project docs [here.](Test_Reports_and_Coverage_Files/)

*Note: The Reports in form of inteactive webpage that can be accessed using any web browser. All the source files are located locally in "Test Coverage Reports" and "Test Result Reports" folder. To access the reports, the user can download both of the folders on local machine and run index.html file using a web browser.

Below is the snapshot of test coverage for various classes and activities. As shown in the report, we are acheiving 88% branch coverage and 95% statement coverage (751 out of 790 lines covered). 
![Test Coverage](Images/TestCoverage.PNG "Test coverage")

*Note: The coverage statistics also includes some of the operations in DB class that aids in testing. This methods are not useful for running of the application, so tests for such methods were not implemented. This is the reason covergae for DB class is comparitively low. Actual test coverage for the application is even higher than what above statistics suggests.
