**Author**: Chris Crabtree>

## 1. Introduction

SDPCryptogram is simple Android game puzzle game.  This game presents the user with a simple interface that can be used to generate and share cryptographic puzzles on an Android device.

## 2. Process Description


1. Coordinating
   - Description: Coordination of team member schedules. Establishing communication protocols between team members
   - Entrance Criteria: Triggered by release of project requirements for this phase
   - Exit Criteria: Team members have all spoken in person. Collaboration platform chosen and all members have access

2. Designing and planning
   - Description:
     - Refine the initial design based on new requirements and understand of the assignment.
	 - Identify required documentation per the assignment.
	 - Define functional tests
	 - Define extra requirements
   - Entrance Criteria: All team members have read the current assignment.
   - Exit Criteria: Team members have assignments and know which deliverables they are required to produce.  

3. Documentating
   - Description:  Team member creates assgined documents.
   - Entrance Criteria: Completion of design and planning activities (#2)
   - Exit Criteria: Assigned documents are checked into the repo.

4. Developing
   - Description:  Team members create application activities and layouts.  Team members write Java code to support the app's activities.  Team members write unit tests to verify the functionality and correctness of Java code.
   - Entrance Criteria: Design work has completed.  (#2)  Documentation is in progress or has been completed. (#3)
   - Exit Criteria: All application activities and Java code have been written and checked into the repository.  The application meets functional requirements and the classes and methods of the Java code pass unit testing. (#5)
   
5. Testing
   - Description:  Team members execute unit tests on Java code.  Team members perform function testing on the application.
   - Entrance Criteria: Unit testing for classes and methods begins when they are added to the repository.  Funcational testing of the application is carried out as features are implemented in development.  (#4)
   - Exit Criteria: The application substantially passes functional testing.  Java classes and methods substantially pass unit testing.

6. Reviewing
   - Description:  Team members review documentation and test results.  Team members provide feedback and indicate any updates needed in processes 3 and 4.
   - Entrance Criteria: Each document can be reviewed when it is submitted into the repo in the documentation phase. (#3)  Test results are reviewed as they are generated. (#5)
   - Exit Criteria: All documents have been reviewd by at least one other team member.  All test results are reviewed by at least one other team member.

 7. Submitting:
    - Description:  A single team member merges all branches and submits the assignment.
	- Entrance criteria: All documents have been submitted and reviewed.
	- Exit criteria: The last commit ID is submitted.
